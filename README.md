# About-me
Hi, I’m Ana Baquedano
- 👀 I'm a experienced ✨ Headhunter and Career Coach ✨ with a demonstrated history of more than 17 years working internationally in the staffing and recruiting industry, mainly in Digital & Tech.
Despite my academic background, I am so passionate about technology and that is the reason why I oriented my professional career to Digital & Tech. I really enjoy a good conversation on new technologies and want to keep updated on market trends.
- 🌱 I love data, so I’m currently learning Data Analysis (Be kind, I'm just a beginner - First time in my life with a programming language: Python and R)
- 💞️ I’m here looking to help all the techy community to find the job of their dreams.
